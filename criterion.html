<h1 id="measuring-functions-in-criterion">Measuring Functions in Criterion</h1>
<p>I’ve recently spent a fair amount of time with Haskell’s <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/criterion">Criterion</a> library for measuring performance. I found myself somewhat disappointed by the performance of Criterion itself, and so am taking a whack at speeding it up. I now find myself multiple issues deep into the codebase, and a good deal more familiar with both Haskell and Criterion.</p>
<p>Haskell is often criticized as being hard to reason about, so I thought I would write up my experiences. As Criterion is one of the sources of truth about the performance of Haskell code, the changes I made have to be verified through other means. I’ll try to provide evidence from both the compiled core/stg/cmm and examples that I hope to turn into tests.</p>
<h2 id="the-measurement-loop">The Measurement Loop</h2>
<p>At the highest level, Criterion measures functions by running them in batches. It will run the function an increasing number of times until it can make a “valid” measurement. At the moment, the batch must run for 30ms to be considered statistically significant. Thus, a function that takes 1s must run once and a function that takes 1ms must run thirty times.</p>
<p>The batching and measurement both come with their own overhead, so care must be taken not to include those in the final result. Keeping that goal in mind, here is a simplified version of the main loop found in <code>runBenchmark</code>:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell">runBenchmark func <span class="fu">=</span> <span class="kw">do</span>
    start <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> getTime
    <span class="kw">let</span> loop (iters<span class="fu">:</span>niters) prev count acc <span class="fu">=</span> <span class="kw">do</span>
          <span class="co">-- Measure the function for the given</span>
          <span class="co">-- number of iterations</span>
          (m, endTime) <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> measure func iters

          <span class="co">-- Three conditions must be met to end the benchmark</span>
          <span class="co">-- loop:</span>
          <span class="co">-- * The loop has run for at least 5 seconds</span>
          <span class="co">--     (This is a user-settable lower bound)</span>
          <span class="co">-- * At least 300 ms of run time has been measured</span>
          <span class="co">--     (This is 10 times the threshold for valid data)</span>
          <span class="co">-- * At least 4 measurements have been made</span>
          <span class="co">--     (This is a slightly flawed check to make sure the</span>
          <span class="co">--      statistics work)</span>
          <span class="kw">if</span> endTime <span class="fu">-</span> start <span class="fu">&gt;=</span> <span class="dv">5000</span> <span class="fu">&amp;&amp;</span>
             prev <span class="fu">+</span> measuredTime m <span class="fu">&gt;</span> <span class="dv">300</span> <span class="fu">&amp;&amp;</span>
             count <span class="fu">&gt;=</span> <span class="dv">4</span>
            <span class="kw">then</span> <span class="kw">do</span>
              return (m<span class="fu">:</span>acc)
            <span class="kw">else</span>
              loop niters (prev<span class="fu">+</span>measuredTime m) (count<span class="fu">+</span><span class="dv">1</span>) (m<span class="fu">:</span>acc)
    loop [<span class="dv">1</span><span class="fu">..</span>] <span class="dv">0</span> <span class="dv">0</span> []

measure func iters <span class="fu">=</span>
    <span class="co">-- See /Reducing GC/ Below</span>
    performGC
    startStats <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> getRTSStats
    startTime <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> getTime
    <span class="co">-- See /Reducing Allocation/ below</span>
    runRepeatedly func iters
    endTime <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> getTime
    performGC
    endStats <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> getRTSStats

    <span class="co">-- Measure returns a /Measured/ record,</span>
    <span class="co">-- and time at end of measurement.</span>
    return (mkMeasured endStats startStats, endTime)</code></pre></div>
<p>With that, it becomes much easier to talk about particular optimizations. I made two major changes of interest. When I first started looking into the performance issues, I noticed right away that the main issue was garbage collection. The two solutions to that are reducing allocation and removing memory leaks. In my case, reducing allocation did not help performance much, but it did help correctness. There also was not a memory leak, but there was a large working set. So I had to reduce the impact of garbage collection.</p>
