<h1 id="measuring-functions-in-criterion">Measuring Functions in Criterion</h1>
<p>I’ve recently spent a fair amount of time with Haskell’s <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/criterion">Criterion</a> library for measuring performance. I found myself somewhat disappointed by the performance of Criterion itself, and so am taking a whack at speeding it up. I now find myself multiple issues deep into the codebase, and a good deal more familiar with both Haskell and Criterion.</p>
<p>Haskell is often criticized as being hard to reason about, so I thought I would write up my experiences. As Criterion is one of the sources of truth about the performance of Haskell code, the changes I made have to be verified through other means. I’ll try to provide evidence from both the compiled core/stg/cmm and examples that I hope to turn into tests.</p>
<h2 id="the-measurement-loop">The Measurement Loop</h2>
<p>At the highest level, Criterion measures functions by running them in batches. It will run the function an increasing number of times until it can make a “valid” measurement. At the moment, the batch must run for 30ms to be considered statistically significant. Thus, a function that takes 1s must run once and a function that takes 1ms must run thirty times.</p>
<p>The batching and measurement both come with their own overhead, so care must be taken not to include those in the final result. Keeping that goal in mind, here is a simplified version of the main loop found in <code>runBenchmark</code>:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode haskell"><code class="sourceCode haskell">runBenchmark func <span class="fu">=</span> <span class="kw">do</span>

          <span class="co">-- * At least 300 ms of run time has been measured</span>
          <span class="co">--     (This is 10 times the threshold for valid data)</span>

          <span class="co">--     (This is a slightly flawed check to make sure the</span>
