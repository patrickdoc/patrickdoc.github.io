<p>A reasonably large and well-known benchmark is the dictionary comparison from the Haskell performance group on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/haskell-perf/dictionaries">dictionaries</a>.</p>
<p>I recently ran it on my computer using <code>ghc-8.2.1</code> and <code>criterion-1.3.0.0</code>, the latest release. There are about 200 benchmarks in the <code>time</code> executable. Using the built-in lower bound of 5 seconds per benchmark, the total run time can be estimated to be 16-17 minutes. When I ran it, I got this:</p>
<pre><code>  895,066,273,808 bytes allocated in the heap
1,472,538,253,152 bytes copied during GC
      306,722,520 bytes maximum residency (75761 sample(s))
       43,151,456 bytes maximum slop
              871 MB total memory in use (0 MB lost due to fragmentation)

                                    Tot time   (elapsed)   Avg pause  Max pause

  Gen  1     75761 colls,    0 par  1465.572s  1467.816s   0.0194s    0.7871s

  INIT    time    0.000s  (   0.000s elapsed)
  MUT     time  680.000s  ( 681.203s elapsed)
  GC      time 1896.640s  (1899.839s elapsed)
  EXIT    time    0.000s  (   0.005s elapsed)
  Total   time 2576.640s  (2581.048s elapsed)

  %GC     time      73.6%  (73.6% elapsed)

  Alloc rate    1,316,273,932 bytes per MUT second

  Productivity  26.4% of total user, 26.4% of total elapsed
</code></pre>
<p>The mutator time is around 11 minutes, which is slightly less than estimated. But the garbage collection time is a gob-smacking 30 minutes. With verboisty on, you can see that some benchmarks are taking much longer than their 5 seconds. The worst offenders all follow a similar pattern; they are fast functions with large environments. (The output has been trimmed for space reasons)</p>

<p>This is what sent me down this road in the first place, so let’s see how it runs after my optimizations.</p>
<pre><code></code></pre>
<p>It turns out that the vast majority of the improvements came by switching to <code>performMinorGC</code> instead of <code>performGC</code>, but I think the other changes were worth it. When the number one suggestion for reasoning about Haskell code is “benchmark it”, your benchmarks better be pretty darn accurate.</p>
